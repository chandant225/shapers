    <h3>Shaping Mental Health</h3>

    <p>Mental health is a growing and silent pandemic in Nepal. A recent national survey estimated that while 10% of adults had faced some mental health related problem, 94% of them did not seek help due to associated stigma. This was prior to COVID-19 related lockdown and restrictions, which have served to since accelerate the scale of mental health challenge in Nepal.</p> 
    
    <p>Poor awareness about mental health, its semantics and its spectrum in our community lie at the heart of the problem. They help constrain proper identification, labeling and communication of our emotions while also serving as a barrier to seeking help.</p>
    
    <p>Shapers from Kathmandu Hub, driven by individual mental health experiences and the desire to bring positive change in the existing status quo on mental health, launched a collective project titled Shaping Mental Health. The foundations for the project were built using learnings from another hub initiative (Building Emotional Resilience for Entrepreneurs) where young entrepreneurs were enabled to explore their emotional wellbeing through participatory.  The project now ties together multiple such individual initiatives all aimed towards our goal, to destigmatize mental health.</p>

        <h3>Online Advocacy</h3>

        <p>Our project was launched with an advocacy campaign under the banner #youmatter on 11th January 2020. Our video outlined key statistics related to mental health in Nepal, which at time of writing had over 5500 views across different platforms.</p>
        
        <p>With the access to digital media, there's every kind of information at your fingertips. With a sensitive topic like mental health, it is even more important that we share and advocate the right information.</p>
        
       <p> As a part of our Shaping Mental Health campaign, we wanted to clarify some of the mental health myths. An online campaign was devised given our target group of youth and was delivered under three thematic areas:</p>
       <ul class="list-disc">
           <li>‘Mythbusters’ that busted common myths around mental health</li>
           <li> ‘Mental Health Semantics’ where we talked about what related terms meant</li>
           <li>‘Climate Change for Mental Health’ that provided information on climate change and mental health in 2021 has helped organically reach over 44000 Nepali’s. </li>
       </ul>

        <h3>Man ka Kuraharu Podcast (Conversations of the Heart)</h3>
        <p>Manka Kuraharu is a regular podcast that explores mental health and well-being through different lens and perspectives</p>
        
        <p>01: The Learnings of the Lockdown<br/>In this very first episode of Manka Kura, we talk about our lockdown experiences and the lessons we learned. </p>
        
        <p>02: The Question of Big B<br/>
        In this second episode of the podcast, we talk about an issue which is one of the most stress causing issues for young people in Nepal - the issue of marriage. </p>
        
       <p> 03: The Gender Burden<br/>
        In this third episode of our podcast, we discuss the disproportionate burden women are having to face because of the patriarchal norms in the society.</p>
    
       <p> 04: Job vs Business<br/>
        In this fourth episode, we discuss a major dilemma young people face these days- should they opt for a job or start their own business?</p>
        
        <p>05: Mental Health in an Unequal World<br/>
        For the Mental Health Day 2021, the theme this year is Mental Health in an Unequal World. So, Shaper Gunjan Ghimire decided to have a chat with mental health experts Kripa and Kapil. What followed was an exciting dive into Nepal's mental health sector and this year's theme.</p>
        
        <p>06: Talking Mental Health in the Workplace<br/>
        In this fifth episode, we talked about mental health in the workplace; how we talk, share and respond to each other, dealing with employee’s change of behavior (burnout, stress, anxiety, absenteeism etc.) and to deal better with mental well-being</p>

        <h3>Building Emotional Resilience in Entrepreneurship</h3>
        <p>The Entrepreneurs are expected to face and overcome challenges. They talk about their successes and maybe nowadays successful entrepreneurs even share their early failures. What is more often than not left out is the effect of starting an enterprise on entrepreneurs' emotional well being - the missed dinners, late work nights and anxiety over interest payments.</p>
        
       <p> The story is no different for Nepali entrepreneurs, It is not an easy task to open up about emotional wellbeing in Nepal where the best response you often get when you open up is a customary ‘estai ho’ [it is how it is].</p>

        <h3>Wellness Weekends For Relief</h3>
        <p>In the wake of COVID-19 second wave crisis in Nepal, Global Shapers Kathmandu Hub Mental health team organized a fundraiser called WellnessWeekends4Relief. The idea was to use social media platforms to ask for donations in exchange for wellness activities and classes hosted over 4 weekends. There were altogether four (4) 1-hour sessions hosted on each Saturday starting on May 15, 2021. The sessions were as follows:</p>
        <ul class="list-decimal">
            <li> Breath and Stretch for Stress Relief with Naviya Kafle</li>
            <li> Mindful Coping with Anisha Jhujhunwala</li>
            <li>Salsa your Stress Away with Ashok Bhandari</li>
            <li>Fueled by Fitness with Anjana M. Kayastha</li>
        </ul>

<p>We have collected donations to any amount through E-Sewa/Khalti. Our goal was to raise as much money as we can to help those in need, as well as offer programs that address mental health struggles that a lot of people were going through COVID19 pandemic. </p>

<p>We have been able to fundraise NPR 50,000 through this initiative, which has diverted the funds to organizations i.e. Hami Nepal Youth Organization  (working in various areas of COVID crisis management) and Women for Human Rights Food Bank (providing meals to families and daily wage workers) who were working tirelessly to address the crisis. Women for Human Rights used the funds to provide cooked meals to health workers. Whereas, Hami Nepali Youth Organizations used the funds to donate rations to 178 people living with disabilities. we transferred the remaining amount of Rs. 23271 to SOCHAI for the Nutrition Drive program. But instead, upon emergency, they bought tarpaulin for flood victims in Sindhupalchwok, which they sent in collaboration with Help Nepal Network.</p>

        <h3>Mess Up Nights</h3>
        <p>The prevailing culture among Nepali professionals is to hide rather than accept our mistakes. The Shaping Mental Health team in Global Shapers Kathmandu Hub discovered through conversations with young Nepali professionals that they fear sharing their failures or ‘mess ups’ due to a fear of being judged, which over time has a direct impact on their well-being.</p>
        
       <p> We launched ‘Mess Up Nights’ to serve as a safe non-judgemental platform for young professionals to unburden themselves of their mess ups. The Hub also facilitates informal dialogue on areas related to well-being and mental health.</p>
        
        <p>Mess up Nights is a n person event that provides a platform for professionals to talk about their mess ups and own them. We had our first meeting on January 30, 2020 and a total of three mess up nights have been organized since.  mic.</p>
